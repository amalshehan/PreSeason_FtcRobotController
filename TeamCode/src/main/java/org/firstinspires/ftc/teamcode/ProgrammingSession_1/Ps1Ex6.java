/*
    Ps1Ex6:

        Part 1 ->

            All the wheel of our robots rotated 5 times. The circumference of the wheels is 10 cm

            Task 1 - Create two variables "wheelRotation" and "circumferenceWheel"

            Task 2 - Store the above data

        Part 2 ->

            We know that,
                            Distance = Wheel rotation * Circumference of wheel



            Task 1 - Create a variable "distance"

            Task 2 - Calculate how much distance our robot moved using part 1

        Part 3 ->

            We know that,
                            Wheel speed = Distance / Time

                            Motor speed = Wheel speed * Gear ratio

             Task 1 - Create two variables "wheelSpeed" and "motorSpeed"

             Task 2 - Create a new variable "gearRation" and initialize with value 4.0

             Task 3 - Calculate the wheel speed and motor speed based on part 1 and part 2


        Part 4 ->

            Task 1 -> Print all the variables you created in part 1, 2, and 3
