Ps1Ex4:

    Part 1 -> create three variables named "time", "speed", and "distance"

    Part 2 -> Our robot moved at a speed of 3.2 ft/s for 10 seconds.

              Store this data using the variables created at part 1.

    Part 3 -> We know that distance = speed * time.

              Use the above equation to calculate the distance our robot moved and store the data
              in the variable "distance.
